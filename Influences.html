			<h2>Where did it all begin?</h2>

			<p>Agriculture took root and has been around for approximately 12,000 years. It was so impactful, it has been deemed the Neolithic Revolution by modern society. It was only bound to happen that, with the development of games, farming would be included in games. But no one ever thought about making a simulation surrounding farming and the life of a farmer. The most popular example back then of farming within games was The Sims and other online games, but the implementation of it was completely non-personal. There was no narrative or story surrounding the farming and no little NPCs with their own personalities.</p>

			<br>

			<h2>Until Harvest Moon was made!</h1>

			<p>The charm of making a countryside farming life into a game drew audiences in and Harvest Moon quickly made it's way into the graces of popularity. From there, farming games became widely popular, even if they didn't include the level of relationships you could establish with the NPCs. For instance, HappyFarm and FarmVille were one of the most popular online farming games, with FarmVille, at one point in 2010, having 84 million active users.</p>

			<h2>Legacy</h2>
			<p>Farming simulation games continue to be made and are still fairly popular on their own. However, one highly acclaimed game that has taken direct inspiration from Harvest Moon/Story of Seasons is Stardew Valley. The creator of Stardew Valley, Eric Barone, even said it himself in an interview between him and Yasuhiro Wada.</p>
