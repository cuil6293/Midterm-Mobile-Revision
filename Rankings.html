<!-- <h1>Personal Connections</h1>

<p>This is a warning! If you don't want to read my personal experiences with Harvest Moon, you can just continue onto the rest of the website or go about your day. Thank you for sticking long enough to get to this part! If you want to stick around, welcome!</p>

<p>My first ever experience with Harvest Moon was when I was 4-5 years old in Colombia. I would follow my older siblings like a little duckling, often annoying them because that's what siblings do. During their free time at home, they were always playing games on our old white computer that was used for the security cameras in our little restaurant, but I never dared to play because I was afraid of messing it up and because I didn't even know how to use the GBA Emulator my brother installed. One day, I guess they got tired of my incessant questions as to what they were doing and why whole they were playing because they booted up Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town and let me play on their save files.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that I became obsessed with these little pixel games. I would explore multiple releases of classics like Pokemon, Kirby, and Mario. But I always went back to Harvest Moon. It was something about the calming atmosphere, the animals, and the girl with the pink hair (who I'm currently using as the sidebar icon for this page, her name is Popuri) as well as the priest, but we don't talk about him. My siblings each had their own saves and I would always go into their saves and play around until I finally got the courage to start my own save. I didn't get too far though as I was soon whisked away and into the United States.</p>

<p>I didn't take studying English too seriously until we moved again to New York and I realized we would never go back. I didn't even get to stay in the ESL classes for a week before I was moved to a regular class where they assumed the teacher spoke Spanish. However, all the lessons were still in English and I understood nothing, which made me feel dumb and isolated. The only thing keeping me comfort then were the anime and cartoons that were subbed and dubbed in Spanish, but there weren't that many. Eventually though, my siblings saved up enough money together for my birthday and brought me to Best Buy to buy me a brand new pink Nintendo 3DS along with Harvest Moon: A New Beginning, Pokemon: Black and White, and Club Penguin. It was a dream come true and I immediately started playing as soon as I got home. I had been wishing every shooting star, birthday, and fallen eyelash that I would get a Nintendo DS ever since I left Colombia. I was ecstatic and as soon as I got home I began playing the games. They were, as expected, in English, but I didn’t care and played them all anyways. That’s how I slowly began learning English.</p> -->
