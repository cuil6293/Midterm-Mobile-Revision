			<h1>What is Harvest Moon?</h1>
			<p>Harvest Moon is a series of "cozy" farming simulation games <span class="highlighter">created and developed by Yasuhiro Wada</span> in <span class="highlighter">Victor Interactive Software, but now known as Marvelous Inc</span>. Harvest Moon games revolve, not only around farming, but the interactions between the player and different characters, pets, and the environment around them. These games focus on both satisfying chill gameplay and a little narrative where you get to choose what your character does in the quaint little towns the games take place in, this is seen by how they often include a system for friendship and love points for each villager. The game doesn't try to rush the player, and the player can take their time taking care of crops, animals, or even just chatting it up with the townsfolk and sometimes even a goddess!</p>
